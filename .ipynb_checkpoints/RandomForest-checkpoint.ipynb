    " - A random forest is an ensemble machine learning model. It makes a classification by aggregating the classifications of many decision trees.\n",
    " - Random forests are used to avoid overfitting. By aggregating the classification of multiple trees, having overfitted trees in a random forest is less impactful.\n",
    " - Every decision tree in a random forest is created by using a different subset of data points from the training set. Those data points are chosen at random with replacement, which means a single data point can be chosen more than once. This process is known as bagging.\n",
    " - When creating a tree in a random forest, a randomly selected subset of features are considered as candidates for the best splitting feature. If your dataset has n features, it is common practice to randomly select the square root of n features."
