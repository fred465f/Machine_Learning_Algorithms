    "Info:\n",
    " - Good decision trees have pure leaves. A leaf is pure if all of the data points in that class have the same label.\n",
    " - Decision trees are created using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes finding the feature that results in the largest information gain when splitting the data using that feature.\n",
    " - The higher value of maximum depth causes overfitting, and a lower value causes underfitting"

    " - Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize.\n",
    " - It can easily capture Non-linear patterns.\n",
    " - It requires fewer data preprocessing from the user, for example, there is no need to normalize columns.\n",
    " - It can be used for feature engineering such as predicting missing values, suitable for variable selection.\n",
    " - The decision tree has no assumptions about distribution because of the non-parametric nature of the algorithm."

    "Cons:\n",
    " - Sensitive to noisy data. It can overfit noisy data.\n",
    " - The small variation(or variance) in data can result in the different decision tree. This can be reduced by bagging and boosting algorithms.\n",
    " - Decision trees are biased with imbalance dataset, so it is recommended that balance out the dataset before creating the decision tree."
